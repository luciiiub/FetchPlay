## Challenge Outcome

- A random ball (of 3) is generated at a random `x` position above the screen  
- When the user presses spacebar, a dog is spawned and runs to catch the ball  
- If the dog collides with the ball, the ball is destroyed  
- If the ball hits the ground, a **“Game Over”** debug message is displayed  
- Dogs and balls are removed from the scene when they leave the screen
